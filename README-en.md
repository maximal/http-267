# HTTP 267 Doubtful But Okay
It is proposed to create an HTTP status `267 Doubtful But Okay` which is a meme reference to an interview quote[0] by Oleg Tinkov[1].

This response status of a web server or application means that the parameters (URL or data) of the request have questionable semantics (possibly, the client has provided contradictory data), but nonetheless, the request has been accepted and processed.

## Выбор кода и сообщения статуса
The status code 267 was chosen based on Oleg's year of birth (1967).

The status message is a translation of Oleg's words from an interview with Yuri Dud "Сомнительно, но окэй" into English.
