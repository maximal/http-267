# HTTP 267 Doubtful But Okay
It is proposed to create an HTTP status in the name of Oleg Tinkov `267 Doubtful But Okay`.

This web server or application response status means that the parameters (URL or data) of the request have questionable semantics (perhaps conflicting data was passed by the client), but the request is nevertheless accepted and processed.


## Selecting a code and status message
Status code 267 is chosen by Oleg's year of birth (1967).

The status message is a translation of Oleg's words from his interview with Yury Dud "Doubtful, but okay" into English.
